Congratulations to Min-Chen He for presenting her research, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng, at the *TWELF 2025 International Conference*. The study examined the impact of one-to-one computing policies on teachers and students. Findings show that while these policies increase technology use in traditional teaching, they do not significantly enhance innovative teaching practices or student learning outcomes. The results suggest that while technology access improves integration, its effect on teaching innovation and learning remains limited.
