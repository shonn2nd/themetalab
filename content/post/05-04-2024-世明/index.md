Kudos to Shih-Ming for presenting his insightful research at the *Prospects for Future Teachers and Future Teaching* conference, in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng. The study compared the online learning experiences of first-generation college students with their peers, focusing on factors such as motivation and self-regulated learning. Initial findings suggest that first-generation students, contrary to common assumptions, demonstrated strong engagement and learning outcomes, often surpassing their non-first-generation peers in key areas. These results challenge the deficit perspective and promote a more asset-based view of first-generation studentsâ€™ potential in remote learning environments.
