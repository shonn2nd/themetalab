Congratulations to Nurul Annisa and Sung-Chan Ku for publishing their article, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng, in the *European Journal of Psychology of Education*: "The roles of peer learning and professional learning in the quantity and quality of teachers’ perceived technology use: A process-and-product perspective."

This study addressed the gap in understanding how teachers’ regulation of learning (peer learning and professional learning) impacts technology integration, independent of internal and external factors. Using a nationally representative sample of US teachers (n = 3197), we found that perceived school support and teacher beliefs predicted both dimensions of regulation. Significantly, peer learning predicted both the quantity and quality of technology use, while professional learning predicted quality. These results emphasize that regulation of learning is a critical, active process and component of successful technology integration, beyond the influence of teacher beliefs alone.
