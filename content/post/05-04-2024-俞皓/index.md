We are excited to announce that Hao Yu, in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng, presented his research titled *"Technology Integration Requires High Expectancy and High Value"* at the *Prospects for Future Teachers and Future Teaching* conference. Their research delves into the significant impact of teachers' beliefs—particularly their expectancy and value—on the effective integration of technology in classrooms. The study reveals that when teachers have both high expectations of technology's effectiveness and a strong belief in its value, its use in teaching increases dramatically.

This collaboration provides important insights into how educators can enhance technology use in their classrooms by addressing these key motivational factors, offering valuable implications for future educational practices and policies
