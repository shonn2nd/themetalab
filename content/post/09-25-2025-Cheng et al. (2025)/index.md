Congratulations to Sung-Chan Ku for publishing his research, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng and Dr. Sheng-Shiang Tseng, in the *Journal of Education for Teaching*. The article, *The Influence of Teachers’ Beliefs and Experience on Effective Instructional Practices in Online Learning Environments*, explores how teachers’ competence beliefs, value beliefs, and teaching experience shape their effectiveness in online instructional practices. 

Using path modelling, the study found that competence and positive value beliefs positively predicted effective online practices, while constructivist pedagogical beliefs enhanced instructor support. In contrast, traditional pedagogical beliefs negatively predicted practices that foster personal relevance and equity. Teaching experience was positively associated with promoting peer interaction, with notable interactions between positive value beliefs and traditional pedagogical beliefs. 

The findings highlight the complexity of teachers’ beliefs and emphasize the importance of competence and value beliefs in preparing teachers for effective online instruction. This research provides valuable implications for teacher professional development and the design of equitable, engaging online learning environments.
