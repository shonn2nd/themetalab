Congratulations to Sung-Chan Ku for presenting his research, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng and Nurul Annisa, at the *15th Asian Conference on Psychology & the Behavioral Sciences* in Tokyo, Japan. The study examined the relations between pay, job satisfaction, and turnover intention using a nationally representative sample of workers in Taiwan. The results show that pay significantly reduces turnover intention but does not affect job satisfaction. Additionally, job satisfaction moderates the effect of pay on turnover intention, strengthening the negative relation when satisfaction is high. These findings suggest that enhancing both pay and job satisfaction simultaneously are crucial in minimizing turnover intention.
