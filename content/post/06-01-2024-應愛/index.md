We are pleased to announce that Vivi Ying's paper, titled *"A Study of Relations Among Health Service Quality, Customer (Patient) Satisfaction, and Customer Loyalty: A Case of Dental Clinics,"* has been published in the **Journal of Global Knowledge Development** (Volume 2, Issue 2, June 2024, pp. 1-24).

This study addresses the important relationship between the quality of healthcare services, patient satisfaction, and customer loyalty, focusing on dental clinics. The research highlights several key findings:

1. Functional quality moderates the relationship between technical quality and patient satisfaction.
2. Functional quality also moderates the indirect effect between technical quality and patient loyalty.

The study concludes that while technical quality is critical, maintaining high functional quality is essential to improving patient satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately strengthening the doctor-patient relationship.
