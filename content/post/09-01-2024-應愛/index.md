We are excited to announce that Vivi Ying's research paper, titled *"A Study of Relations Among Person-Job Fit, Job Satisfaction, and Intention to Stay: A Case of Healthcare Workers,"* has been published in the **Management Information Computing** journal (Volume 13, Issue 2, 2024, pp. 252-261).

Given the challenges in retaining healthcare workers due to increasing turnover and the aging population, Vivi Ying's study is highly relevant. The research revealed that:

1. Person-job fit positively correlates with job satisfaction.
2. Job satisfaction is strongly linked to the intention to stay.
3. Person-job fit also positively influences the intention to stay.
4. Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between person-job fit and intention to stay.
