Congratulations to Jai-Wen Tsai and Sung-Chan Ku for publishing their article, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shonn Cheng, in the *Journal of Military Studies*: "A scoping review of research on the turnoverintention of military personnel in Taiwan."

Using a scoping review methodology, the study found that psychological factors, including job stress, burnout, well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment, were the most consistent predictors of turnover intention. In addition, work-environment factors, such as supervisor support, organizational support, and personâ€“job fit, had a significant impact on turnover intention, above and beyond demographic factors. Personal characteristics, such as gender, rank, and tenure, were found to have inconsistent direct effects, indicating their role as moderators or indirect factors rather than primary drivers.

The findings underscore the complexity of the factors influencing military personnel turnover and highlight the importance of addressing psychological and environmental factors to mitigate turnover. This research provides valuable implications for improving military retention strategies, training programs, and creating supportive work environments to retain personnel and enhance organizational commitment.
