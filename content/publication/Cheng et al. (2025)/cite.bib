	abstract = {The present study aimed to examine the relations between teachers’ beliefs, teaching experience, and effective instructional practices in online learning environments. Using path modelling, the present study found that competence and positive value beliefs positively predicted various effective online instructional practices. Negative value beliefs did not predict any instructional practices. Constructivist pedagogical beliefs positively predicted instructor support. Traditional pedagogical beliefs negatively predicted fostering personal relevance and equity. In addition, there was an interaction between positive value beliefs and traditional pedagogical beliefs. Teaching experience positively predicted promoting peer interaction. The study highlights the complexity of teachers’ beliefs and points out the importance of competence beliefs and positive value beliefs in relation to effective online instructional practices. Teachers with low competence beliefs, low positive value beliefs, and high traditional pedagogical beliefs are less likely to be ready to teach online classes effectively.},
