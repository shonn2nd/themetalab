abstract: This review aims to determine the scope of exist-ing literature, summarise key findings and identify gaps forfuture research. Following the Preferred Reporting Items forSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) report-ing guidelines, this scoping review initially identified 346studies on the turnover intention of military personnel inTaiwan. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria,17 studies were ultimately included in the final analysis.Findings indicate that psychological factors, such as jobstress and job satisfaction, play a crucial role in military per-sonnelâ€™s intention to leave. Additionally, work environmentfactors significantly predict turnover intention beyond psy-chological factors, as they contribute to the fulfilment ofbasic psychological needs. However, personal character-istics show inconsistent effects. The practical implicationssuggest that reducing turnover intention among militarypersonnel requires fostering adaptive internal statesthrough need-satisfying work environments. Addressingwork-related stressors and enhancing job satisfaction couldhelp mitigate turnover risks. Although turnover intention iswidely studied in industrial and organisational psychology,it remains understudied in military contexts. As a result, thekey antecedents of turnover intention among military per-sonnel, as well as the mechanisms underlying these rela-tionships, remain largely unknown. This scoping reviewcontributes to bridging this gap by synthesising existingfindings and offering a foundation for future research onmilitary turnover intention.
