	abstract = {This review aims to determine the scope of existing literature, summarise key findings and identify gaps for future research. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, this scoping review initially identified 346 studies on the turnover intention of military personnel in Taiwan. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies were ultimately included in the final analysis. Findings indicate that psychological factors, such as job stress and job satisfaction, play a crucial role in military personnelâ€™s intention to leave. Additionally, work environment factors significantly predict turnover intention beyond psychological factors, as they contribute to the fulfilment of basic psychological needs. However, personal characteristics show inconsistent effects. The practical implications suggest that reducing turnover intention among military personnel requires fostering adaptive internal states through need-satisfying work environments. Addressing work-related stressors and enhancing job satisfaction could help mitigate turnover risks. Although turnover intention is widely studied in industrial and organisational psychology, it remains understudied in military contexts. As a result, the key antecedents of turnover intention among military personnel, as well as the mechanisms underlying these relationships, remain largely unknown. This scoping review contributes to bridging this gap by synthesising existing findings and offering a foundation for future research on military turnover intention.},
