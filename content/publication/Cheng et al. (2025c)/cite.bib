	abstract = {Research on technology integration has been fruitful. For the past two decades, several studies have been conducted to identify factors that are associated with teachers’ perceived technology use in classrooms. Despite the valuable contributions of this line of inquiry, there is limited understanding of the process in which teachers actively participate in learning how to use technology in classrooms (i.e., regulation of learning) and how that process is related to their perceptions of external factors, internal factors, and perceived technology use in classrooms. The goal of the present study was to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of two dimensions of regulation of learning: peer learning and professional learning. Leveraging a nationally representative sample of in-service teachers in the USA (n = 3197), the present study found that perceived school support and teacher beliefs predicted both dimensions of regulation of learning. Peer learning significantly predicted both the quantity and quality of perceived technology use, while professional learning significantly predicted the quality of perceived technology use over and beyond the effects of teacher beliefs. These findings demonstrate that apart from teacher beliefs, regulation of learning serves as a critical component and process of technology integration.},
