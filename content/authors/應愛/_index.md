I have a background in technology and healthcare management. My research within the field of human resources primarily focuses on employee job satisfaction, retention intentions (turnover tendencies), person-environment fit, and basic psychological needs. Specifically, I am interested in the perspectives of healthcare workers and social workers regarding their work environments, and I am currently conducting research in these areas. Additionally, I have a strong interest in marketing, particularly in consumer satisfaction and loyalty.
