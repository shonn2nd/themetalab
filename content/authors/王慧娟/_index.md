嗨，我是慧娟。身為一位熱情活潑、正直善良的學習者，我面對挑戰與創新充滿熱情；並以積極認真、重視團隊合作的態度，溝通與解決問題，以學習促進自我成長。在航空業累積了多年的職場經驗，擔任訓練講師，設計並組織多項培訓課程，提升全球相關業務人員的專業能力與表現。同時也身兼全球場站業務溝通與管理職責，協助解決場站運作中的問題，確保各項業務順暢。本身亦執行跨系統、跨部門的專案，透過有效的協調與溝通，推動專案落地並達成既定目標，展現專案管理與問題解決的能力。重返校園，是希望把多年實務經驗轉化為具備扎實理論的研究成果，學習新知並不斷充實自我，成為更專業的專業人士，是我目前最重要的目標。「用心學習、勇於創新、落實執行，成就更好的自己！」。

Hi, I’m Lisa Wang. I’m a happy, lively, and kind learner who loves new ideas and challenges. I work diligently, value teamwork, and I’m good at talking with others and solving problems. I keep learning to grow. I’ve worked in the airline industry for many years. Now I am a training teacher who designs and delivers many courses to help staff around the world do better at work. I also handle global station communications and teamwork, solving on-site problems to keep things running smoothly. I lead cross-system, cross-team projects and I work well with others to get things done. This shows I can manage projects and solve problems. Going back to school, my goal is to turn many years of work into solid ideas and research, learn new things, and keep getting better. “Study diligently, try new ideas, and do what it takes to become a better me!”
