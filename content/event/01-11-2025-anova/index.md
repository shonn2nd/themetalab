summary:
abstract: 'Dr. Shonn Cheng recently conducted an *R U Serious* session for META Lab members via Teams, focusing on one-way ANOVA, post-hoc Games-Howell tests, and their interpretation using R. This hands-on workshop guided participants through the process of performing one-way ANOVA to compare group means, conducting Games-Howell post-hoc tests to address unequal variances, and evaluating effect sizes, including omega-squared (ω²) for assessing the proportion of variance explained by the group differences. Dr. Cheng emphasized clear and accurate interpretation of results, providing participants with practical tools to effectively apply these methods in their research and academic writing.'
