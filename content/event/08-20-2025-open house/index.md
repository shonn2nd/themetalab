summary:
abstract: 'As part of the new student orientation at the Graduate Institute of Technological and Vocational Education (GITVE), National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), the META Lab hosted an Open House to introduce incoming students to the lab’s research focus and community.

Dr. Shonn Cheng, Assistant Professor at GITVE and Director of the META Lab, invited three members to share their experiences: Ph.D. student Sung-Chan Ku, M.A. graduate Shih-Ming Lin, and current M.A. student Min-Chen He. Their presentations highlighted how the META Lab supports research in motivation, expertise, technology-ehnaced training, and analysis, and how members collaborate on academic projects and professional development.

The session provided new students with insights into the lab’s work and an open invitation to join its growing community of scholars.
