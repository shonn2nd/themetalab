summary:
abstract: 'Dr. Shonn Cheng recently conducted an *R U Serious* session for META Lab members via Teams, focusing on independent samples *t*-tests and their interpretation using R. This hands-on workshop guided participants through the process of performing independent samples *t*-tests, evaluating effect sizes, and converting Cohen&#39;s *d* into percentiles to enhance the practical understanding of statistical results. Dr. Cheng emphasized clear and accurate interpretation of results, providing participants with the tools to effectively apply these methods in their research and academic writing.'
