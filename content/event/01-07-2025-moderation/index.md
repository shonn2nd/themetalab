summary:
abstract: 'Dr. Shonn Cheng recently conducted an in-person *R U Serious* session for META Lab members, focusing on moderation analysis using the PROCESS Macro and probing interactions with the Johnson-Neyman technique accompanied by visualization. This hands-on workshop guided participants through the process of setting up moderation models, interpreting conditional effects, and visualizing interaction effects to provide a clearer understanding of complex relationships. Dr. Cheng emphasized the importance of accurate interpretation and effective communication of results, equipping participants with the skills to apply these advanced techniques in their research and academic writing.'
