abstract: 'Dr. Shonn Cheng recently led the *R U Serious* session for META Lab members via Teams, focusing on essential data analysis techniques. The session covered saving descriptive statistics as objects in R, exporting these tables to Excel, and copying the tables into Word for seamless integration into reports. Participants also learned reliability analysis to assess internal consistency in survey constructs, equipping them with valuable skills for developing their methodology and results chapters in theses and dissertations.'
