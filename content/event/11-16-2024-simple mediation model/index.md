summary:
abstract: 'Dr. Shonn Cheng recently led an *R U Serious session* for META Lab members via Teams, focusing on building foundational skills in mediation analysis. The session introduced members to the PROCESS macro, developed by Dr. Andrew Hayes, and guided them step-by-step in conducting a simple mediation model. Participants learned to interpret the output and effectively report indirect effects, equipping them with practical skills for analyzing mediation processes and incorporating these findings into their theses and dissertations.'
