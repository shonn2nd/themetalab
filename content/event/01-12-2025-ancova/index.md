summary:
abstract: 'Dr. Shonn Cheng recently conducted an *R U Serious* session for META Lab members via Teams, focusing on Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), post-hoc comparisons, and their interpretation using R. This hands-on workshop guided participants through the process of performing ANCOVA to compare group means while controlling for covariates, conducting post-hoc tests to explore specific group differences, and evaluating effect sizes, including partial eta-squared (η²) for assessing the proportion of variance explained by the group differences. Dr. Cheng emphasized clear and accurate interpretation of results, providing participants with practical tools to effectively apply these methods in their research and academic writing'
